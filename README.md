I developed a Jupyter notebook visualizing bike riding & weather patterns in the Twin Cities as part of my final project for my Programming for Data Science course. I developed my initial draft, which included over a dozen visualizations and two hundred lines of code, in three days in early December 2018; it has undergone many, many improvements and iterations since.

Minneapolis has been consistently recognized as one of the bike friendliest cities in the continental U.S, and as recently as 2015 was named the #1 bike friendly city in America.

Here in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis & St. Paul, MN, we have the bike-sharing nonprofit company Nice Ride MN that was introduced in 2010. Customers can rent bikes at stations that are scattered throughout both cities. Customers can then bike around to their preferred location and return their bike at any other station, providing there's an empty dock for it.

As an avid biker during the spring/summer/fall months, I noticed that my own riding patterns dropped off once the days grew shorter and the temperatures began dropping below freezing. I decided to look at if and how ridership in the Twin Cities is affected by the weather patterns and changes throughout the year.
